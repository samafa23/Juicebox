Project 16

I didn't know if I needed the README.md but the github thing said that If I wasn't using an exisiting resporitiory than I should, so I did! 

This project is to initize and learn PSQL! Have fun looking at my mess c:


NOTES:

1. Changed "scripts" in package.json to "seed:dev": "nodemon ./db/seed.js"
    - "seed:dev" could be bananas
    - nodemon watches live the changes we make to the indicated folder/file
